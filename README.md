# movieAPI

I developed an iOS application that makes API calls to retrieve lists of movies. On the main page, I display three different movie lists. I also included a movie details page. I aimed to create generic code, hid keys and URL addresses in the info.plist, and modularized the code by creating a specific service for the calls, placed in a separate package (Swift Package Manager).
